# Saturated integer arithmetic on the Intel x86

This is a purely for-fun project, conceived during one of my sleepless nights in order to actually do something relevant instead of just staring into the screen.

None of these implementations have been subjected to any kind of benchmarking, so I'm not making any guarantees regarding their performance on particular CPUs.

The code is provided for your enjoyment as public domain. I hope it can also make as a useful tool while learning assembly language.
